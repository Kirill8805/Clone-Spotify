[00:09.07] Yellow diamonds in the light
[00:11.69] And we're standin' side by side
[00:15.97] As your shadow crosses mine
[00:19.46] What it takes to come alive
[00:25.89] It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
[00:33.84] But I've gotta let it go
[00:37.33] We found love in a hopeless place
[00:41.33] We found love in a hopeless place
[00:45.08] We found love in a hopeless place
[00:48.77] We found love in a hopeless place
[00:52.80] 
[01:13.53] 
[01:23.44] Shine a light through an open door
[01:26.36] Love and life I will divide
[01:30.36] Turn away 'cause I need you more
[01:33.84] Feel the heartbeat in my mind
[01:38.00] It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
[01:45.90] 
[01:50.06] But I've gotta let it go oh oh ohh
[01:54.32] We found love in a hopeless place
[01:56.47] We found love in a hopeless place
[02:00.14] We found love in a hopeless place
[02:03.99] We found love in a hopeless place
[02:10.90] 
[02:16.72] Yellow diamonds in the light
[02:19.15] And we're standing side by side
[02:23.63] As your shadow crosses mine
[02:31.12] We found love in a hopeless place
[02:34.37] We found love in a hopeless place
[02:38.06] We found love in a hopeless place
[02:41.05] We found love in a hopeless place
[02:46.41] 
[03:16.21] We found love in a hopeless place
[03:19.18] We found love in a hopeless place
[03:23.42] We found love in a hopeless place
[03:26.40] We found love in a hopeless place
[03:30.94]
